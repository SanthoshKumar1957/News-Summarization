The echoes have still not died down from the extraordinary allegation made by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. He said in parliament on September 18, “Canadian security agencies have been actively pursuing credible allegations of a potential link between agents of the government of India and the killing of a Canadian citizen, Hardeep Singh Nijjar".

It seems that Trudeau’s official statement was triggered by his discovery that Canadian officials were leaking the story to the media and he wanted to pre-empt the Globe and Mail. This seems preposterous—a media story would never have done a fraction of the damage that a statement in parliament by the prime minister of Canada could—but it ties in to Trudeau’s anxiety to appease the pro-Khalistan elements in his country, especially given his minority government’s dependence on political support from the New Democratic Party led by the pro-Khalistani Jagmeet Singh. It seems Trudeau wanted to ingratiate himself with them by being the one to make the announcement, rather than let the media take the credit.

The government of India has predictably reacted as the offended party and “rejected” the allegations as “absurd”. Since the initial statement and New Delhi’s reaction, both countries have taken several retaliatory steps, and tensions have escalated with each. Both have evicted intelligence officers attached to their embassies in Ottawa and New Delhi. Then India halted visa services in Canada, saying its diplomats there were not safe, and ordered Canada to reduce staffing at its embassies and consulates in India by 41, to match the size of the much smaller Indian diplomatic presence in Canada.
