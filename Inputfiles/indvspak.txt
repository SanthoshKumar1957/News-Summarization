India maintained the clean sheet over Pakistan in the ODI World Cup history with a seven-wicket win over the side in Ahmedabad on Saturday. This was India's record-extending 8th win over their arch-rivals at the mega event. India's bowling attack contributed equally as the side bundled out Pakistan for 191 runs after skipper Rohit Sharma opted to bowl first. Babar Azam (50) and Mohammad Rizwan (49) looked promising but other Pakistan batters failed to impress. For India, Hardik Pandya, Kuldeep Yadav, Jasprit Bumrah, Ravindra Jadeja and Mohammed Siraj scalped two wickets each. In reply, Rohit's blazing 86-run knock and Shreyas Iyer's unbeaten 53 guided India home.
